### Purpose

In 2019, the rules of kata competitions have been transformed. In the past, kata competitions consisted of individual confrontations. Now it has been replaced by a system of ranking by score where the best ranked move on to the next rounds, and the others are eliminated.  

There are a few studies on katas in high level competition. However, the knowledge on this field is still new and limited.  

The objectives of this notebook are then as follows:  

- to collect as much data as possible on high level kata competitions since the implementation of the new rules.  
- to show which katas are the most used, in particular which katas are used for the first rounds or for the finals.
- to show which katas are the best rated by the jury.  
- to compare the scores obtained by the katas of particular styles of karate.
- to propose visualizations for the above points, for general and category-specific data (men, women, teams, etc.).
